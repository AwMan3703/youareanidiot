#### When the main window is closed, it gets cloned into two (or more) new ones >:)

The program resists closing via Task Manager. To forcefully terminate it:
1. Create a file named `iamanidiot.txt` in the SAME DIRECTORY as the executable from which the program was launched
2. In said file, on any line, write `allow-forceful-kill`
3. Kill the program via Task Manager
